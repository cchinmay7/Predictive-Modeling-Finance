# Predictive-Modeling-Finance
Analyzing weekly stock performance via machine learning in finance.

As part of my final project for the Mathematics for Machine Learning class I analyzed a 21-year weekly stock market dataset (1990-2010) comprising 1,089 observations. Employed Python's pandas and statsmodels libraries for data loading, preprocessing, and logistic regression analysis. Explored relationships between lag variables, trading volume, and market direction, revealing key predictors influencing stock market behavior over time. The project involved data cleaning, feature engineering, and informative visualizations to enhance understanding and decision-making in financial markets.
